'''
This script will turn an xml file exported from draw.io containing lines and polygons
into a representation in the "Well-known text representation of geometry" (WKT) format.
It will read the file path to the xml file as it's only argument and output the file map.wkt.
The script will simply overwrite map.wkt, should it already exist.
